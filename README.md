# get-grades
For Rice University students waiting for final grades to be posted.

Run directly from your Python IDE of choice, or from the command line 
(If you don't know how to run a Python Script from the Command Line, here's a useful tutorial: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1522564/how-do-i-run-a-python-program)

Simply enter your Student ID Number and Password in the fields of the program, and once you run it, get-grades will check every 10 minutes on Esther for new grades, printing them if new grades have been entered.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Will only correctly check for new grades for classes that you have filled out Course Evaluations for, so make sure that you've done this!

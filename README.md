Simply enter your Student ID Number and Password in the fields of the program, and once you run it, get-grades will check every 10 minutes on Esther for new grades, printing them if new grades have been entered.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Will only correctly check for new grades for classes that you have filled out Course Evaluations for, so make sure that you've done this!
